## Introduction

This project marks my first experience with HTML and CSS, as I recreated a website for a medical clinic based on the design and specifications provided by my professor. The website provides essential information about the clinic, including operating hours, a contact form, available specialist doctors, and a simple appointment booking feature.

## Features

- Faithful recreation of the medical clinic website based on the provided design.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- Clear presentation of clinic hours, contact details, and services offered.
- Details of specialist doctors available at the clinic.
- A straightforward appointment scheduling form for patients.
